## Generating the figures  

For each figure, data used are in the folder *data* in a file named *FigXX_data.tsv.gz* for all tabular data and in *FigXX_data.rds* for non tabular data. Bigwig files used for Figures 5, S3, S8 and S9 are also provided. Data file have been built using either reads, forks or initiation/termination data provided by the NFS scripts from the *Forks_Detection* folder.  
Scripts to generate the figures are in the folder *scripts* and requires **R**.  
Raw figures are in the *figures* folder.  
Statistical analysis used to indicate significant changes is explained in the manuscript and is based on reproducibility of the observed effect.
